# Product Requirements Document: RetroScope

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a web application designed to make team retrospectives more engaging, efficient, and "delightful." Current retrospective processes can be slow, awkward, and suffer from a lack of follow-through on action items. This application aims to address these issues by providing a structured, interactive, and integrated platform for conducting retrospectives, primarily targeting remote team members and Scrum Masters. The goal is to improve team communication, increase engagement during retrospectives, ensure better follow-up on action items, and make the overall process smoother and more enjoyable.

## 2. Goals

*   Increase engagement and participation in retrospective meetings.
*   Improve the identification and clarity of common themes and discussion points.
*   Streamline the process of capturing, assigning, and tracking action items.
*   Make the retrospective experience more enjoyable and less awkward, especially for remote teams.
*   Facilitate better follow-through on action items post-retrospective.
*   Integrate with existing team workflows and tools.

## 3. User Stories

*   "As a scrum master, I want to easily set up a retro board with customizable columns so that I can tailor it to my team's needs."
*   "As a user, I want to be able to express myself freely without fear of retribution for my opinions, so I can provide honest feedback."
*   "As a remote team member, I want a clear, structured flow for the retrospective (collection, sorting, discussion, action items) so that the meeting is efficient and productive."
*   "As a scrum master, I want to easily export the retrospective summary and action items so that I can share them with stakeholders or archive them in our knowledge base (e.g., Confluence)."
*   "As a team member, I want to be able to react to and vote on feedback items so that we can quickly identify the most important topics for discussion."
*   "As a scrum master, I want to integrate the retrospective tool with Jira so that action items can be seamlessly created and tracked."
*   "As a team member, I want AI assistance to help synthesize common themes from the collected feedback so that we can focus our discussion more effectively."

7.  **Integrations:**
    7.1. **Jira Integration:** Ability to create Jira issues from action items generated in the retrospective. This requires API key management for data integration.
    7.2. **Slack Integration:** Notifications in Slack for new retrospectives, reminders, or summaries. This requires API key management.
    7.3. **GSuite Integration:** For user authentication and potentially calendar integration for scheduling.
8.  **AI-Powered Enhancements:**
    8.1. AI assistance to help synthesize and identify common themes from feedback during the sorting/analysis phase.
    8.2. (Future consideration) AI suggestions for action items based on discussed topics.
    8.3. (Future consideration) AI-powered sentiment analysis on feedback.
9.  **User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX):**
    9.1. The application must have a modern look and feel, with good use of gradients and white space.
    9.2. The application must support a dark mode.
    9.3. The application must provide a responsive and intuitive mobile experience.
    9.4. The application should facilitate a smooth flow between retrospective stages.
    9.5. Mechanisms to help resolve conflicting opinions respectfully (e.g., anonymous voting, facilitated discussion prompts - specific UI/UX TBD).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope for Initial Version)

*   Advanced real-time collaborative editing features beyond the core retrospective board interactions (e.g., concurrent document editing like Google Docs).
*   Complex organizational hierarchy management beyond simple teams.
*   Video/audio conferencing capabilities (users will use existing tools like Zoom, Google Meet).
*   Full project management capabilities (focus is on retrospective action items, not general task management).

## 6. Design Considerations

*   **Look and Feel:** Modern, clean, with effective use of gradients and ample white space to reduce clutter.
*   **Dark Mode:** A high-quality dark mode theme must be available and easily accessible.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** The application must be fully usable and provide a good experience on common mobile devices (smartphones and tablets).
*   **Accessibility:** Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines should be a target.
*   **Delightful Interactions:** Incorporate subtle animations, positive reinforcement feedback, and intuitive controls to make the experience enjoyable. AI assistance should feel seamless and helpful, not intrusive.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   **Existing Stack:** Leverage the existing project's technology stack where appropriate.
*   **API Keys:** Secure management of API keys for integrations (Jira, Slack, GSuite).
*   **Scalability:** Design with potential for future growth in users and data.
*   **Security:** Standard security practices for web applications, including data protection for user accounts, retrospective data, and API keys.
*   **AI Integration:** Carefully select and integrate AI models/services, considering cost, performance, and data privacy.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   **User Adoption:** Number of active users and teams.
*   **Engagement:**
    *   Frequency of retrospective sessions conducted through the app.
    *   Average number of feedback items per session.
    *   Percentage of participants actively contributing (adding items, voting, commenting).
*   **Action Item Follow-through:**
    *   Percentage of action items created that are marked as completed.
    *   Integration usage (e.g., number of Jira issues created from the app).
*   **User Satisfaction:**
    *   Qualitative feedback from users (surveys, interviews).
    *   Net Promoter Score (NPS).
*   **Reduction in "Awkward Silence":** Qualitative feedback indicating retros feel more dynamic and less stilted.
*   **Improved Theme Identification:** Feedback that teams are better able to see common topics.

## 9. Open Questions

*   What specific AI models or platforms are preferred for the AI-assisted features?
*   Are there specific GSuite APIs that need to be prioritized for integration beyond authentication (e.g., Calendar for scheduling, Drive for exports)?
*   What level of customization is needed for retrospective templates beyond column names?
*   How should user roles and permissions be managed within a team (e.g., who can create/edit retros, who can manage team members)?
*   Detailed error handling and conflict resolution strategies for real-time interactions (e.g., if two users try to edit the same item simultaneously, though this is less of a concern than full collaborative editing).
*   Specific requirements for data retention and archiving of retrospective data.
